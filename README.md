Browser Masker
================

Quickly mask your opened window when leaving the page.
Really handy when your mother, boss or (girl)friend suddenly walks into the room and you are doing something they shouldn't see (you know, like when you're buying them a gift).

### How to use
1. Click the bookmarklet.
2. Leave the page (for example by opening a new tab).
3. Return to the page and click the bookmarklet a second time.
